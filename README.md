By using a python program I coded, I found that the two real numbers x were:
-17.509122 and 11.68736. 
I found -17.509122 using the bracket {-20, -15}, and 11.68736 with {10, 15}. 
The determinant error using -17.509122 as x is .048308, (determinant was 4999.951692)
and using 11.68736 as x is .013596. (determinant was 5000.013596)

X-Values:	      -17.509122	   11.68736
Determinant:	 4999.951692	   5000.013596
Error:	           .048308	   .013596
